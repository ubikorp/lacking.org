*Editor's note: In order to provide the most legible version of the following text, we have used machine translation to convert the version presented by Hrvst, nominally in English, to his native peculiar Upper Europan dialect, then back again. It seems to have improved things somewhat. In summary, Julius C. Lacking has been doing this radio thing for about 10 years now, and is on the air on KAFM Grand Junction (CO) on alternate Tuesdays from 9 pm to midnight Mountain time. Check the [Radio Activity](/radio-activity) page for details.*
