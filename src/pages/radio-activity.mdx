### Esteemed potential listeners--

A messagegram to elucidate the scheduling of periodic activity! On these dates and times, it is a near-certainty that you can tune in to a type of rambling haphazard musical junkyard, with yours truly deliberating in between with lots of um's and factoids.

## How to Listen

### Analog

Analog listening via the electromagnetic spectrum is available to denizens of Colorado's Grand Valley when broadcasting through the services of gracious community radio station KAFM, on the FM realm frequencies of 88.1 MHz (near the Grand Junction end of things) and 96.9 MHz (closer to the Palisade agrarium).

Use your home "radio" for this option. We hear tell of daring mobile radios, installed in automobiles, whose operation should be self-similar. Tune said beast to the frequencies listed. Important: this activity must take place at the designated time for procedure to work.

### Digital

Use your Computor Station to decode a fanciful stream of 1s and 0s into an audio simulacrum of the happening!

For broadcasts originating on KAFM, "point" your "browser" to the following "link": **[kafmradio.org](https://www.kafmradio.org/)** -- therein you can locate a button stating "Listen Live." "Clicking" on this item will bring up a strikingly different web page, whose footer displays a conventionally accessible "Play" button. A further "click" on this button will comence the modern wizardry that bring the listener my voice directly to the speaker outputs of their chosen decoding device.

For broadcasts originating on Louder Than War radio, a similar accessory is available on the **[Louder Than War Radio](https://louderthanwar.com/louder-than-war-radio/)** internet blog page. A "click" on the orange "Listen Live Here" button located centrally on this directory will yield a stream of ones and zeros which your decoding device will magically translate into the sound of my voice.

For broadcasts originating on Mixcloud, a direct link is available -- **<a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/live/the-lacking-org/" target="_blank">The Lacking Organization Live on Mixcloud</a>**. A visit to this web location will yield an audiovisual presentation of unexpected proportions!

## Streaming Archive

KAFM radio broadcasts are archived on **[Spinitron](https://spinitron.com/KAFM/show/100988/The-Lacking-Organization)** and are available for streaming for two weeks after the airdate. Use the calendar to locate the date and time of the show you want to hear, then follow appropriate internet instincts to initiate delivery of time-preserved bytes to your device of preference.
