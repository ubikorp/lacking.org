I will be present on the air this coming Friday morning (August 10) from 6am to 9am (Mountain time), attempting my best to assist the navigation of the deep, frightening valley between waking and coffee, or whatever routine you choose to establish your presence upon this sphere.

Plans call for the selection of minimalist compositions, mostly of electronic nature, at varying levels of energy. I'll do my best to ramp things up from gentle awakening to out and out rambunctious. Join me for the whole ride, or tune in as appropriate on KAFM 88.1 / 96.9 or [kafmradio.org](https://kafmradio.org).

A schedule of upcoming engagements is available at the [Radio Activity]({% link pages/radio_activity.md %}) page.
