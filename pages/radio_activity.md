## How to Listen

### ANALOG:

Analog listening via the electromagnetic spectrum is available to denizens of Colorado's Grand Valley when broadcasting through the services of gracious community radio station KAFM, on the FM realm frequencies of 88.1 MHz (near the Grand Junction end of things) and 96.9 MHz (closer to the Palisade agrarium).

Use your home "radio" for this option. We hear tell of daring mobile radios, installed in automobiles, whose operation should be self-similar. Tune said beast to the frequencies listed. Important: this activity must take place at the designated time for procedure to work.

### DIGITAL:

Use your Computor Station to decode a fanciful stream of 1s and 0s into an audio simulacrum of the happening!

For broadcasts originating on KAFM, "point" your "browser" to the following "link": **[kafmradio.org](https://www.kafmradio.org/)** -- therein you can locate a menu item stating "Listen." "Hovering" on this item will bring up a further menu refinement listing a staggering variety of available options. This enables the selection of platform-specific wizardry! Operate your Computor accordingly, and do this at the appropriate time for your chosen option.
