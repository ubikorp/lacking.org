## theme song

**A Little Special** is a scripted program in which each episode presents a guest host, their musical obsession, and three of their favorite songs. The guest hosts are fairly idiosyncratic themselves, and their interests make sense, in a way. For example, Alexander Graham Johnson works as a lineman, and loves songs featuring telephone conversations and answering machine messages.

Episodes will be released monthly, on [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/the-lacking-org/) and aired on [KAFM](https://kafmradio.org/) as a feature in the Lacking Organization [radio show]({% link pages/radio_activity.md %}).
