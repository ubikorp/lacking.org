2023-04-11,,,,,,"The carefully curated collection of artists performing tracks made famous by other artists continues, in the third annual **Version Control**. Some of these could be so obscure as to ask “is it a cover if I never heard the original” but we can leave the answering of that to the armchair philosophers. I’ll go on the record saying a good song is a good song no matter who performs it. Also, to the listener and fellow cassette afficionado that complained about Maxell and Memorex being mentioned in the same breath: my point is that neither one of them is TDK.",,,,,
