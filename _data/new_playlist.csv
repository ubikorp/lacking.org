"2024-07-02","0","","","","","It was a night for mazzy music, starting with a startlingly woozy track from **Maya Hawke** and following up with entries from many other exemplary female vocalists with a unique sense of melody and delivery. Also, it’s now light when I leave for the radio station, and midnight when I return, which adds a sense of interdimensional time travel to the broadcasting ritual, I’m going to enjoy that for a few more shows before it’s back to operating under the cover of darkness."
