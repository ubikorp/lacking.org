2023-01-03,,,,,,"Tonight’s opening theme is clearly tribute to the Imaginary City — the opening cover is from the town’s **The Streetwalkin’ Cheetahs**, who are named after an Iggy and the Stooges lyric and have been pumping out a corresponding racket for about 30 years now. The song itself, originally by X, is about a friend of the band that left for England to hook up with the Damned’s Captain Sensible. The lore is unclear on whether the Captain was expecting that or not.",,,,,
