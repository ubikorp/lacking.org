"2024-06-18","0","","","","","Back to the tried and true formula of new, old, obscure, and occasionally weird with tonight’s set, which features the return of **Les Savy Fav** and their always welcome abrasive electropunk. It’s now that time of year when I enter the studio in daylight and exit in pitch black darkness, which I always appreciate. In between, there were lots of exciting discoveries. Expect more heavily-censored Guppy in coming weeks!"
