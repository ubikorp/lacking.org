The Cop Shoot Cop Show
2010/04/04

This Heinous Bienf√§ng and his Malevolent Underlings performance took place in April 1993 or 1994... nobody is sure, and the official records are sealed until 2035. It's converted from an audio cassette recorded straight from the soundboard, so there's some noise, wacky levels, who knows what. Plus something special during "Mexican Vacation" to cover up the gap left by the tape flipping sides.
