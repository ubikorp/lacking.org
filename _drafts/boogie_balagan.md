Letters - Boogie Balagan
2009/01/21

I got a copy of <em>Lamentation Walloo</em> today from the kind folks at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/boogiebalagan">Boogie Balagan</a>. I know, MySpace link, but their <a href="http://lamentation-walloo.com/">official website</a> isn't as informative, and of course even that is relative. They appear to have an international colony of members, with a strong Israeli undercurrent, and the package came from France. And they collectively and informally refer to themselves as "The Donkeyzzzz," as the note included indicates.

The package took a while to get here, as it was addressed to the antipodal Melbourne in Australia, instead of the Melbourne, Florida, US where I live. But still! Some folks at the Melbourne AUS postal service must be used to it and quite amused, as this happens a few times each year. Note: anyone over there that wants to help this band please chime in below in the comments, as Australia is a big priority for the band. Maybe Florida can be next.

Anyway, I'm giving it a spin as we speak, and I'm sure you'll be hearing yourselves it in future shows. Thanks, Donkeyzzzz!
