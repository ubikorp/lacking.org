Bankfighting

This morning I spent a half hour on the activity I like to term "bankfighting." If the meaning isn't obvious to you, it's the process wherein you find that your bank has committed its latest act of egregious fee greed, and now you must do battle to regain your cash, and maybe some dignity.

This financial tilting at windmills, at least in my experience, never quite fixes things, but I feel better afterwards, knowing that if I don't at least object, then the terrorists have already won. The latest case involves a bounced statement, which resulted in my mailing address being immediately expunged from the account and a monthly "Special Mail Handling Fee" being added to my account for the service of not sending me statements anymore.
