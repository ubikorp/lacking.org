AxeCop: The Meme

It's rumored that Nikola Tesla once built a simple mechanical device which, when placed somewhere inside a building, would find the structure's natural resonance and exploit it in a way that would have the building shaking itself to pieces within an hour.

I think internet memes work in the same way — something resonates in the popular hivemind and before you know it, it's reproducing, mutating and evolving its crashing way to the beach, where it sprays out in  glory before being washed under by the next meme and the tragic intangibility of mixed metaphors.

So let's wade in <a title="Axe Cop: The Comic" href="http://axecop.com/" target="_blank">Axe Cop</a> for a bit. There's nothing unusual about a web comic put together by brothers, Ethan and Malachai Nicolle in this case. The spin comes from the 24-year age difference, with Malachai's kindergarden-level writing chops being mated to Ethan's near-30s artwork.

The effect, as you'd expect, is slick and surreal. Malachai's fevered 6-year-old imagination is somewhat reminiscent of Japanese narrative WTFness, but at heart is just plain eager to take on a plot twist, no matter how nonsensical. Come to think of it, it's no less credible a police drama than <em>Face-Off</em>, <em>Con-Air</em>, or any number of hyphenated Nic Cage vehicles. Let <a title="Axe Cop: The Movie" href="http://vimeo.com/19119108" target="_blank">this trailer</a>, freshly mutated off the original strip, serve as testimony.
