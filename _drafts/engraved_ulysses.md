It seemed like a good idea at the time, Craig Venter's encoding of a passage from <em>Ulysses</em> into the man-made DNA code of their self-claimed "synthetic life form." Now the estate of James Joyce <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/davidewalt/2011/03/14/craig-venters-genetic-typo/">wants their cut</a>. Think about it — this leak is an order of magnitude bigger than the most successful torrent out there. There could be billions of copies out there, and almost as many people waiting for Apple to approve the synthetic life form reader app. It's a slippery slope, folks.
