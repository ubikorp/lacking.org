Awesome Xmas 2008
2008/12/18

Greetings loyal listener(s)! In anticipation of the upcoming barrage of nonstop auditory Xmassery, I have prepared an antidote: <em>Awesome Xmas 2008</em>. Twenty shiny AAC files (compatible with your iTunes and iPod), wrapped up in fancy tartan .zip and presented with a nod to <em>Boogie Nights</em> as a bow. It goes offline after the holidays, so download yours today!
