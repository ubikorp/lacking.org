I've been sucked into the story ofÂ <a href="http://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/enemies/">Alice and Kev</a>, two characters in The Sims 3 which their creator has deemed shall be homeless. Alice is on the cusp of being a teenager, while Kev is her dad, an irascible, irredeemable lout. They sleep on benches in the park, where Kev raids nearby trash cans and Alice cadges the occasional meal from the kindly older folks nearby (who seem to be losing their patience with the whole arrangement).

It's fascinating because, given only a handful of basic human traits and preferences, what we see play out is disturbingly lifelike. I'm linking to somewhere in the middle of the story, where things are coming to a head, but if you'd like to start from the beginning, here you go: <a href="http://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/alice-and-kev/">Alice and Kev: Genesis</a>.

What exactly is <em>The Sims 3</em> saying about human nature? Are things really not that complicated? Can all this misery really be explained by the fact that some people aren't, well, nice?
