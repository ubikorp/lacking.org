I'm digging <em>Late Night Heartbroken Blues</em>, the 2006 debut album by Sweden's <a title="Miss Li's Øfficial Sitë" href="http://www.missli.se/">Miss Li</a> (aka Linda Carlsson). Miss Li — it doesn't feel right to address her as an unadorned "Li" — sings in lovely lilting English, and with the sort of edgy little-girl warble that you associate with girls who shred your heart with the casual off-handedness that some people use to pick at their beer bottle labels during conversation.

Witness the video for "Oh Boy," a song which is more than a bit twee, but whose video (a tribute to the Cure's "<a title="...which I like more." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBe2WqpLmk">Close To Me</a>" video, intentional or not) is quite fun:
