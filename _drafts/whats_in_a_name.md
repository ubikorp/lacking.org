Heath Campbell wonders why it's so <a href="http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/index.ssf?/base/news-0/122923112231930.xml&amp;coll=3">difficult to purchase an inscribed birthday cake</a> for his adorable toddler, pictured at right. It's hard to figure out which is more disturbing: That someone named their child "Adolf Hitler," that a newspaper devoted the equivalent of five web pages for the story, or that I read all five. At least I can justify that last one, by extracting the one useful-to-everyone nugget from the article:

<blockquote>The grocer offered to make a cake with enough room for the Campbells to write their own inscription. But the Campbells refused, saying they would have a cake made at the Wal-Mart in Lower Nazareth Township. The Campbells say Wal-Mart made cakes for Adolf's first two birthdays.</blockquote>
