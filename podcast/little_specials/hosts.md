Something that’s a Little Special
A series of micro-specials dedicated to their hosts’ favorite music.

Teakettle
WITH ZELDA CHOMSKY

What is more pleasing to the ear than the pure sound of a lonesome whistle, a single solitary whistle perhaps backed by a full complement of bluegrass instruments, or maybe even a complete rock band? Zelda Chomsky is haunted by the sibilant sounds in music, zeroing in quickly on those pieces with a whistling solo, slide whistle, or train sample. When not sharing the piercing sounds of her selections, you can see Zelda behind a spangle of leashes as one of Midtown’s most sought-for dog walkers.

The Good Times Fun Revue
WITH BRYANT HARDY

A familiar faces to students, staff and faculty of East West Melbourne University, Officer “Party” Hardy has been with Campus Security for going on 5 years now, and has distinguished himself with his peerless golf cart skills, which on rare occasion are requisitioned to the cause of rapid replenishment maneuvers. Nobody’s getting hurt, and one of these kids could get mashed up on the road, OK? Officer Hardy is always invited, and he’s bringing you along as a special guest to his mug-raised foam-flecked yeast-stained litany of music suitable for bringing sobriety into submission. Just don’t get him started on Andrew WK.

The Ocho
WITH TRISTAN KEGEL

Not everyone can call themselves a professional conspiracy theorist, but when you meet someone who does, you better not ask for details, not if you have to be somewhere else before sunrise. So take our word for it, Tristan Kegel works his terrible and secret knowledge to dark ends that make the world a better place. For you and me, of course. Tristan could show you the cryptic messages behind any number of selections, but he will focus exclusively on songs about the number Eight, which he tells us is not only a vertical infinity sign, but also two circles, and two times two, twice.
The Beep End
WITH ALEXANDER GRAHAM JOHNSON

One of a breed dying as fast as the home phone, Alexander Graham Johnson comes from a family with a long history of owning telephones. His great-grandfather, “Big Ring” Johnson, is documented as having made the first collect call to New York City (the charges were refused), and his grandfather, “Little Ring” Johnson, was reputed to silently replace the receiver on the cradle in the middle of a telephonic marketeer’s patter. In keeping with the family legacy, AG “Fourth Ring” Johnson features songs which make use of recorded phone calls, and even some of that newer “mail of voice”.

About A Girl
WITH KEVIN BANG

Kevin knows he has to follow the sun. As one of the world’s most in-demand ice cream truck drivers, Kevin is frequently crossing the equator and finding himself where the heat is blazing and the girls need a little bit of his cooling magic. On the plastic rack by the register sits a haphazard collection of mix tapes given to him by his so-called “popsicle girlfriends”, spanning years of stolen kisses and black eyes, and yielding some awesome memories and scary scares for old Kevin. He loves to tell the story of each of his favorite songs and how that girl has no idea what she’s missing.

Musical Kingdom
WITH “THE ZOOKEEPER”

Because some of the bands he collects could be considered endangered, “The Zookeeper” insists we can’t use his real name, and must even refer to him in quotes for extra deniability. Having been on the internet for forever, “The Zookeeper” has visited websites on over 90 top-level domains, and even browsed some Unicode URLs. His passion for bands named after beasts exotic or jejune is evident in his record collection, which he likes to call “The Bestiary”. Those quotes are ours.

Zelda Chomsky:

“Thanks muchly, Julius!  It’s so nice to be with you to talk about one of my favorite instruments - the slide whistle.  Much like the fretless bass, the slide whistle offers the performer the unique ability to sculpt and characterize the notes.  Except the slide whistle occupies a much more shrill and harsh portion of the sonic spectrum.

The song I’ve chose to highlight this underutilized piece of the Musician’s Toolbox is "I Like Bananas (Because They Have No Bones)" by the Hoosier Hot Shots - a band from one of the Plains States...I forget which one, actually.  But you can just HEAR the dryness and desolation communicated through the slide whistle on this one.

Pay special attention to the chorus, where the Hoosier Hot Shots break with tradition and give us not one, but two different rhythmic cadences for the listener’s ear to flirt with.

But enough yakkin from ol’ Zelda, let’s check out "I Like Bananas (Because They Have No Bones)" by the Hoosier Hot Shots!”



“Hey JC!  Let’s get back on the WhistleBus with another installment of Teakettle.

I hope everyone’s wearing their WhistleMuffs, because we’ve got a doozy for you today!  We’re going to listen to Sonny Smith the Wizard of Whistledom as he brings us his international smash hit: ‘X-Man.’

A fun behind the scenes fact that our listeners might not know…  Sonny was actually born with a collapsed lung.  If you know anything about the mechanics of whistling, you’ll know just how much lung pressure is required to obtain such a clear, bell-like tone.  Sonny is a real-life Horatio Algier tale in the WhistleWorld!

I’m still struggling to learn how to whistle.  And I’ve got two big healthy lungs!!!

You know… it’s enough to make a girl a little bit jealous.

SIGH…  Just play the song, Lacking.  Sonny Smith.  X-Man.  Whatever.”



BRYANT HARDY:

“Thanks, Julius!  It’s nice to be here tonight partying with you and your listeners.  I always say: “My judgement is swift, my punishment is fair, and my parties are ROWDY!”  I love songs about having a good time, getting wild, and zipping it up and zapping it out.

You know, when you see me on campus in my Security Golf Cart, don’t get scared.  I usually let things slide if everyone’s got the party atmosphere on lock down.  And the best way to let me know that everyone’s being positive and having a really nice time is to sing my personal favorite party anthem: “Party Weekend” by Joe “King” Carrasco.

The best part about this song is the extended outro.  This version was actually never released on a full length, only on a b-side of a tour only beer-scented Special Party Vinyl.

When the thrills start to thrill and the giggles start jiggling, you can always find Bryant “Party” Hardy doing the thing that must be done.  Legs and arms become a hungry beast for all things fun.

Hey, Julius!  Let’s dance!”


TRISTAN KEGEL:


“No thanks, Julius - I already EIGHT!  Get it?  E-I-G-H-T…EIGHT!  It’s your old pal Tristan Kegel, the Ace of Eights and the Toro Bravo of The Ocho.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: if this paragon of handsomeness loves the number 8 so much, is he going to play “Octopus’s Garden” by The Beatles?  After all, an Octopus has eight tentacles.  But you’d be wrong!  I cannot STAND the Beatles due to their obsession with backmasking and their involvement with The Liverpool Illiuminati. And that Revolution #9 song. NINE!

So, how about “Stop!  In the Name of Love” by The Supremes?  After all, STOP signs have 8 sides, right???

NO!!!  I HATE The Supremes ever since I read that article on InfoWars about notorious gangster Al Capone inventing the SUPREME PIZZA as a mind control device for SUPREME rulership of Chicago.

*sigh*

What, I’m almost out of time?  Rats.  Well, here’s The 88 by French Kicks - a band from Germany with a chip on their collective shoulder.  And that’s all for me, Tristan Kegel, the 8th Wonder of the World.

I LOVE THE NUMBER 8!!!!!”




“Did you read the temperature, Julius?  Don’t you think the nice people listening at home would like to hear the weather report?  Or are you afraid?

Well, I did check the temp before I came in here.  I left a thermometer in my car overnight.  It’s hot and sunny.  Guess what the temperature is?  It’s 151.88 degrees Fahrenheit.

Did you know why the government says not to leave your pets or small children in cars unattended?  It’s not because of the heat. No.  No.  No.  No.  It’s because 151.88 degree Fahrenheit equals exactly 66.6 degree Celsius.

And do you know why we don’t measure the temperature in degrees centigrade?  The same reason JFK was assassinated.  Because Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. loved the number 8.  Just like me.

This week I had planned to take you on a Throwback Tuesday and spend some time with everyone’s favorite Cyrus - Billy Ray.  But then Julius told me that the song was ACHY-BREAKY Heart and NOT EIGHTY-BRADY Heart.  I’ve been mishearing that for over twenty year.

But it makes no difference.  I’ve got another 8-Themed tune for your pleasure.  This is “8 Piece Box” by Southern Culture on the Skids.  Goodbye.”




ALEXANDER GRAHAM JOHNSON:

“Hello hello.  Or should I say ‘AHOY’.  Did you know that ‘Ahoy’ was the original proposed greeting on the telephone?  Think about what a different world we’d be living in now.

Sometimes, when the workday becomes long and boring, I’ll tap into the lines and just check up on you guys - I hope you don’t mind.  It’s usually just static.  I’m all but obsolete.  And nearly dead.

But that doesn’t stop me from getting into the groove and listening to a few tunes with answering machine intros.

Here’s one of my favorites from MC Honky.  It’s called “Soft Velvety ‘Fer” and the intro includes most of a 1974 message left for the bass player’s mother.  It’s sad, embarrassing, and at the same time playful and whimsical.

Later on, please listen for the nearly hypnotic effect as MC Honky honks his way through a myriad of rhymes, dimes, and slimes in his quest to communicate his...MESSAGE!

Hit it, boys!”


KEVIN BANG:

“Ladies, ladies, ladies…  Kevin Bang here tickling your earsnouts and saying good evening to you all.  Fellas, feel free to step outside for a few while I speak directly to the fairer sex…

The summer’s heating up and it’s not easy making things happen when you’re an ice cream man, stuck in the truck while every lady from here to Portugal is frollicking on the beach.  So I gotta keep my mojo flowin’ somehow.  I like to relax with some high quality tunes.

But this is a dudes free zone, no dudes allowed.  You won’t catch Kevin Bang jamming out to Lorne Greene and some Ringo nonsense. Not even Johnny Cash and his boy named Sue.  Just the babes.

So right now, here’s one babe I can’t get out of my head: Molly.  And the song is called Molly, by Ween.

I don’t know anything about music.  So I can’t really say anything about the song.  Or even the lyrics.  I just know that it’s called Molly.  And that I love the honeys.  The ladybugs.  The she-devils.  The dollbabies.

Hit me up later…”
