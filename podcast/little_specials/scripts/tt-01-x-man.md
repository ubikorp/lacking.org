Hey JC!

_ONLINE INTRO_

---

Let’s get back on the WhistleBus with another installment of Teakettle Time.

I hope everyone’s wearing their WhistleMuffs, because we’ve got a doozy for you today!

We’re going to listen to Sonny Smith, the Wizard of Whistledom as he brings us his international smash hit: ‘X-Man.’

A fun behind the scenes fact that our listeners might not know:

Sonny was actually born with a collapsed lung.

If you know anything about the mechanics of whistling, you’ll know just how much lung pressure is required to obtain such a clear, bell-like tone.

Sonny is a real-life Horatio Alger tale in the WhistleWorld!

I’m still struggling to learn how to whistle.

And I’ve got two big healthy lungs!!!

You know... it’s enough to make a girl a little bit jealous.

SIGH...

Just play the song, Lacking.

Sonny Smith. X-Man.

Whatever.

## X-Man / Sonny Smith

Weeee weeee JC!

Weee weeee!

This is my best attempt.

I can’t do it!

I just can’t do it.

I have a plastic whistle for the dogs because sometimes a leash is not going to get a Great Dane’s attention.

But how I wish I could purse my lips and make that sweet singing sigh, the whistle.

But you know who can?

Ted Leo can!

He used to work at a pharmacy or something.

I used to walk his Waffel-hund, or I think one time he bought me a waffle dog.

It’s so silly.

But you don’t have to take my word for it.

This is just such an amazing song, especially the whistling solo part in the middle.

I just wish Ted would do more whistling and less playing the clavinet, or that thing that he hits.

He has a lovely singing voice too!

He should use it less.

So we can all contain ourselves, barely, like a dachsund with a new toy, while Ted Leo does the thing that people tell me he does well, then he whistles!

He whistles!

Sibilations and salutations, JC!

I can’t tell you how excited I am about this next track. At least, I can’t tell you in words. I could maybe whistle it, since whistling is the highest of possible artforms, but alas. I can’t whistle!

Do not be distracted by this tragedy, for there is a whistling solo coming up. Good old Charlie Chesterman. I used to walk his weimeraner. Or maybe I helped him move a chest of drawers one time. I don’t remember! I always figured he was more of a cat person, but I can be wrong some times. It’s allowed. Also, he had a purple rug. Not many people have purple rugs.

After Charlie sorts through his things, and gets in some fancy bassoon or whatever licks, the whistling solo comes up. I can hardly wait, I’m having a hard time not fast forwarding it for you guys. But you have to listen to some lyrics, to appear literate or whatever.

Just play them the track! Get to it.
