## I Like Bananas / Hoosier Hotshots

Thanks muchly, JC!

It’s so nice to be with you to talk about one of my favorite instruments - the slide whistle.  Much like the fretless bass, the slide whistle offers the performer the unique ability to sculpt and characterize the notes.  Except the slide whistle occupies a much more shrill and harsh portion of the sonic spectrum.

The song I’ve chose to highlight this underutilized piece of the Musician’s Toolbox is "I Like Bananas (Because They Have No Bones)" by the Hoosier Hot Shots - a band from one of the Plains States...I forget which one, actually.  But you can just HEAR the dryness and desolation communicated through the slide whistle on this one.

Pay special attention to the chorus, where the Hoosier Hot Shots break with tradition and give us not one, but two different rhythmic cadences for the listener’s ear to flirt with.

But enough yakkin from ol’ Zelda, let’s check out "I Like Bananas (Because They Have No Bones)" by the Hoosier Hot Shots!”
