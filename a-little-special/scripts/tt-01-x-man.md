Hey JC!

_EPISODE_

Hey guys, it's Zelda, and I have fifteen minutes before my next dog-walking appoinment.

It's just about enough time to play you some of my favorite whistling solos.

I love whistling, I think it's a sound that goes beyond the human voice into the realm of absolute purity.

But I have a secret.

Weeee weeee JC!

Weee weeee!

This is my best attempt.

I can’t do it!

I just can’t whistle.

I have a plastic whistle for the dogs because sometimes a leash is not going to get a Great Dane’s attention.

But that's not why I'm here.

We’re going to listen to Sonny Smith, the Wizard of Whistledom as he brings us his international smash hit: ‘X-Man.’

I like to make up facts that our listeners might not know:

Sonny was actually born with a condition called "short lung".

If you know anything about the mechanics of whistling, you’ll know just how much lung pressure is required to obtain such a clear, bell-like tone.

Me, I’m still struggling!

And I’ve got two big healthy lungs!

You know... it’s enough to make a girl a little bit jealous.

SIGH...

Just play the song, Lacking.

Sonny Smith. X-Man.

Whatever.

### &raquo; X-Man / Sonny Smith

How I wish I could purse my lips and make that sweet singing sigh, the whistle, like Sonny Smith.

But you know who else can?

Ted Leo can!

He used to work at a pharmacy or something.

I used to walk his Waffel-hund, or I think one time he bought me a waffle dog.

But you don’t have to take my word for it.

This is just such an amazing song, especially the whistling solo part in the middle.

I just wish Ted would do more whistling and less playing the clavinet, or that thing that he hits.

He has a lovely singing voice too!

He should use it less.

So we can all contain ourselves, barely, like a dachsund with a new toy, while Ted Leo does the thing that people tell me he does well, then he whistles!

He whistles!

### &raquo; Six Months In A Leaky Boat / Ted Leo

Sibilations and salutations, Ted Leo

Do not be distracted by this tragedy, for there is a whistling solo coming up.

Good old Charlie Chesterman.

I used to walk his weimeraner.

Or maybe I helped him move a chest of drawers one time.

I don’t remember!

I always figured he was more of a cat person, but I can be wrong some times.

It’s allowed.

Also, he had a purple rug.

Not many people have purple rugs.

After Charlie sorts through his things, and gets in some fancy bassoon or whatever licks, the whistling solo comes up.

I can hardly wait, I’m having a hard time not fast forwarding it for you guys.

But you have to listen to some lyrics, to appear literate or whatever.

Just play them the track! Get to it.

### &raquo; The Missing Person’s Waltz / Charlie Chesterman

I can’t tell you how excited I was about the last track.

At least, I can’t tell you in words.

I could maybe whistle it, since whistling is the highest of possible artforms, but alas.

I can’t whistle!

But don't worry, guys, I'm going to keep practicing.

In the meantime, if you need to get a hold of me, just purse your lips...

...and send me a text message.
