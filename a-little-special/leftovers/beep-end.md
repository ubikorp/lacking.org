Let’s not get all hung up on this.

I am here to talk about the soundtrack to my gruesome work.

Forget about those Lexicon reverbs and boutique channels, it’s the most expensive effect you can put on your voice by a few orders of magnitude and it’s glorious.

Listeners! Digame (DEE-gah-meh) is how they answer the telephone in Spain. Don’t answer back, because I am not going to hear you. After all, this is not a telephone.

Listeners! Moshi moshi, as they say when they answer the telephone in Japan. It seems more elaborate and formal than our simple “hello”, but you can disagree with me.

Later on, please listen for the nearly hypnotic effect as MC Honky honks his way through a myriad of rhymes, dimes, and slimes in his quest to communicate his...MESSAGE!
