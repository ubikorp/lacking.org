I would like to thank everyone who contributed music for this episode. I received so many amazing entries, but in the end I had about three times more music than I could fit. I picked a couple of personal favorites and let the random do its business. If you sent me a track and it's not here, I apologize for the luck of the draw.

It has been a pleasure to bring this haphazard collection of random sonic excursions to the ears of listeners in Brevard County for eight years. I appreciate all the emails, tweets, messages, and phone calls, even if they have gone unanswered in the frantic cycle that is a weekly radio show. The Lacking Organization may now be off the air, but as one door closes, many others open. Stay tuned for the return of this mess of a musical aggregate in one form or another!
