description: 'It’s been about six months since the previous compliation of music that
  was played on the 11pm-midnight section of the Mixtape — the late-night temporal
  space that receives music that is strange, harsh, and/or repetitive that is known
  as **The Final Hour**. This is the second anthology from this pool of music, presented
  through the entirety of tonight’s Mixtape to allow those whose schedule leans towards
  the earlier hours a chance to experience. Hark! '
