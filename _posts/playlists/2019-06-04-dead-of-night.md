description: Once above the canopy, it was impossible to see the green-winged hang-gliders
  that the archeologist and the mercenary had used to enter the Antananarivo bird
  sanctuary. Going through Customs had been dicey, the parts for the flying machines
  had been dispersed with various kinds of unassembled patio furniture, but the quality
  of the materials still stood out. Fortunately, the mercenary had brought up the
  Madagascar goth metal scene and distracted the functionaries into stamping passports
  and waving them through. They hadn’t even asked about the Geiger counter.
