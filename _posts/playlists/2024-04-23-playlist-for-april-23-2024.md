subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: When you set out to record a song that’s been famous, or popular, or
  claimed in some other way by some other artist, you are taking a shortcut with great
  risks and great rewards. Rarely can you pull it off the way **Chicks On Speed**
  do with their rendition of Cracker’s “Euro Trash Girl,” with a radical approach
  to deconstructing and reassembling the indie country hit. You’ll just have to hear
  for yourself.
