description: Exploding out of upstate New York, **The Bobby Lees** have returned with
  a their third outing, titled *Bellevue*, and it delivers more of that biting, can’t-you-see-I’m-in-the-middle-of-an-episode
  post-rock blues energy. Tonight’s Mixtape closes out with Escape Mechanism’s “Being,”
  sampling William S. Burrough’s unmistakable reedy voice into an existential mantra.
