subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The pilot felt the glider’s control surfaces bite into the updraft. The
  craft smoothly pitched up and right as the surreal Eastern Washington terrain unfolded
  beneath them. The plucky strains of a Bolivian polka filled the small cockpit, the
  whistling of the wind no true competition. Facing backward, the specialist peered
  at the techmapper. Somewhere below, there was something messing with the surveillance
  satellite and downing any powered aircraft that dared approach. Up ahead, the clouds
  were bunched up in a way any seasoned traveler of the skies could tell was just.
  not. right.
