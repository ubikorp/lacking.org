description: This is SOME LIKE IT HOT, a Mixtape of music about all things that are
  Not Cold, an hour of songs about heat and warm places, and bands that celebrate
  this elusive phenomenon. Although sometimes it resorts to extremes, it is hoped
  that this sonic concoction delivers some measure of imaginary heat to the listener.
