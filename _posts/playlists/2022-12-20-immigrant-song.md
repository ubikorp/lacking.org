title: Immigrant Song
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: I used to get a couple of dozen packages containing CDs each day, but
  these days receiving even one is something that happens once in a blue moon, a rare
  treat. It’s even more special when it contains a couple of releases from **Sex Clark
  Five**, one of my personal favorites. They sound like blurting out that thing you
  told yourself you weren’t going to say but felt good to say.
