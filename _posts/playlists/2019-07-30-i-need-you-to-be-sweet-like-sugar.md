title: I Need You To Be Sweet Like Sugar
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Shrugging through the rose thorns, protected by a heavy leather apron,
  the blacksmith adjusted the thick gloves, proof against stray hammers and cinders
  but well-worn enough to allow the gentlest of movements. A stem was carefully pincered
  and brought in view of the entomologist’s face, who scanned it for aphids. Across
  Sarmiento Park, a teen herd’s boombox gave voice to an excited Córdoban DJ, announcing
  the latest from the latin bhangra scene. A traffic cop was nosing around their parked
  Alfa Romeo, assuming it was just another family sedan that forgot to feed the meter.
