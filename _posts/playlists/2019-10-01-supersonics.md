description: The Sasha river was running dry, and the aerialist maneuvered his craft
  to take advantage of the fact. As they moved swiftly along the crumbling banks,
  exoskeletal legs easily scrabbling over the terrain in an unearthly three-limbed
  gait, they encountered sun-baked sections where a trickle fed a series of pools
  on the cracking river bottom, animals congregated around them in a temporary truce.
  They hadn’t seen a human since Saturday, a fact that concerned the actuary more
  than the dry river, and the attempted distraction of some Guatemalan gamelan techno
  was not working. In its steel box, the package of Peanut Butter Crunch patiently
  rustled and awaited its delivery.
