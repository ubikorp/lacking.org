title: Muriel’s Big Day Off
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: A flamboyant tip of the hat to Charley, who shared **Being Dead** with
  me only recently. I am smitten and kicking myself for missing their debut album’s
  release last summer, but I am fiercely making up for lost time. This evening’s Velvet
  Potty Mouth award goes to STRFKR, whose distinctive FUCK sat like a rock in a river
  of glitter and was carefully edited out for the Grand Valley’s sensitive ears.
