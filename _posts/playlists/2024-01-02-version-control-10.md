description: Tonight’s show kicks off with a long overdue hour of **Version Control
  10** — our special blend of songs that you might call “covers”. About a year ago,
  I filled three hours with covers, which leads me to believe something is messing
  with the covers ecosystem, and I have my theories. The middle hour was a regular
  Mixtape (if such a thing can be allowed), and the Final Hour was its usual rocketride
  mindtrip, a big thank you to all that came aboard.
