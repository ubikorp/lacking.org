description: The pair powered down the sand-skis as they approached the slight concavity
  in the beach that had been described by the vendor in the spice market. The cliffs
  of Levera National Park did not seem to be an ideal place for smugglers to congregate,
  but the actuary would be the first to admit they did not know the first thing about
  smugglers and their habits of congregation. The blacksmith was better versed in
  these things, and they didn’t seem to be bothered by where the assignment was taking
  them. As the morning fog absorbed the last echoes of the recently-killed engines,
  they marveled at the conical shape of Sugar Loaf rising above the azure Caribbean
  water.
