subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: 'It’s a bitterly cold night, though the thermometer is not the lowest
  it’s been this winter. Warming things up is **King Tuff**, whose twisted bedroom
  psychedelia is heating up my house in the manner of an unexpected early spring.
  It’s a strong start for an extended set of sounds simultaneously catchy and powerful.
  Technical note: The Mixtape sounds best when recorded on TDK SA90 cassettes. Do
  not attempt to do this on Maxell XLIIs.'
