description: Uwe Schmidt has had an extensive career, recording under many names as
  electronic musicians do, but it's his work as Señor Coconut (and now as Atom™),
  where he deconstructs familiar songs into something Kraftwerk would play if hired
  to play a quinceañera, that brings me this very particular weird glee.
