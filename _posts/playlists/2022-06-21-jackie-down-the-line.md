subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Coming straight outta Dublin, **Fontaines DC** have an insistent and
  incisive sound that carves anthems out of marble using only guitar strings and a
  chiseling voice. No particular theme seems to emerge tonight, although we will be
  closing with Angel Olsen’s “Go Home.” Go home, it’s midnight.
