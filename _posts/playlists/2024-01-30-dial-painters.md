description: There’s a whole new album from **Wreckless Eric**, a whole album, but
  tonight’s selection resonates for the simple fact that this is the third reference
  to the radium girls I’ve heard this week, all from very different sources. As we
  say around these parts, it’s a real plate ‘o shrimp. Also worth noting tonight is
  n-th track from the Bug Club’s _Rare Birds_ album, which has so many good songs
  on it you’ll be hearing from them for months to come, and that’s even with not playing
  the ones with bad words.
