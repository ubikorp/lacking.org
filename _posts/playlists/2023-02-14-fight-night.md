title: Fight Night
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Every six years or so, Valentine’s Day lands on a Tuesday, and it’s a
  grand excuse to update and refine the **Fight Night** playlist, featuring two hours
  of music about verbal, physical, and emotional aggression. Why go the opposite way?
  I’m sure those with dates have better things to do than listen to the radio, and
  those without might appreciate the theme. Tonight’s Final Hour is a replay of tracks
  from another Final Hour from about a year ago, with all-new live commentary from
  yours truly.
