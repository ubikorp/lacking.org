title: Bang Go The Bongos
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The pediatrician scrambled on hands and knees after the rubber ball.
  It deflected off the base of the Monument to Fuel Tanker, his imperturbable brass
  cheer completely unaffected by the collision. The interlocutor looked around surreptitiously.
  Their aim was to provide some normalcy to the fact that two people were hanging
  out near one of the lowest-ranked attractions in Grodno while the sophisticated
  electronics built into their footwear communicated with the satellite and sorted
  out the problem with the statue. But maybe this game of jacks had not been the best
  idea for cover.
