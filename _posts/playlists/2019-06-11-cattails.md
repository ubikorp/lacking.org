description: The catamarine knifed silently upstream, its passage discernible only
  as a faint twin wake on the surface of the river. Up ahead, the sonar array was
  already picking up the turbulence from the Mbocaruzú falls, the staccato warning
  pings slicing neatly between the Mozambique big-band swing being piped into the
  earpieces. In their individual pods, the cartographer and the miner reviewed their
  maps, surveys, and orders. Up ahead, behind the rushing down-flow of the water and
  completely out of sight, a set of steel doors silently opened and awaited the pair’s
  arrival.
