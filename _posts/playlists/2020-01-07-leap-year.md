description: The cryptographer tried to once again estimate the circumference of the
  lighthouse, asking the question aloud and then naming best guesses. The compulsion
  to know these geometric factors was strong. The agronomist successfully prevented
  their eyes from rolling. The history of this place was more interesting, having
  provided a high point from which to shine a light for centuries, currently for Estonia
  but briefly for the Kingdom of Torgu. That last bit of trivia was relevant because
  they were here to meet with the self-appointed Official Court Jester, who had requested
  they journey to this location on a rented tandem bicycle. They had also requested
  ice cream, “any color except white.” It waited in a cooler strapped to the bicycle’s
  ample frame.
