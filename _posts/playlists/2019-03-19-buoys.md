description: I have never been so uncomfortable, thought the hacker as they strained
  to match the wires in the fusebox, their head inches from one of the combine’s many
  potentially lethal harvesting blades. The lookout’s shadow was barely visible against
  the hangar door. Straining to clip the blue wire into the scanner, they heard a
  soft call and nearly lost an ear before remembering their uncomfortable position.
