title: I Can't Stand The Rain
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The rich wood floorboards were squeaking under the strain of the game.
  They had removed their shoes, sketched out the board using a special beeswax that
  would not damage the finish, and were hopping as lightly as they could, for they
  respected the solemnity of their location. Nonetheless, the portraits lining the
  Hall of Admirals in the Museo Maritimo Nacional felt they finally had something
  to frown about, their serious Chilean brows furrowed in naval concern as they observed
  the farrier and the anthropologist enjoying their tournament.
