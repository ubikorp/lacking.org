description: The carpenter took a leisurely walk around the perimeter. In the weird
  light cone projected by the light they had installed at the top of the can, the
  ropes they had used to rappel down looked like the undulating tentacles of a mysterious
  jellyfish. Outside the cylindrical building that very deliberately resembled an
  oversized Coca Cola can, the security guard’s radio played Chicago sambas into the
  crisp Manitoba evening as he idly played his flashlight over the bushes outside.
  The choreographer stifled a giggle. On one of the ornithopters parked atop the domed
  top, next to an opening that looked like someone forgot to bring a canopener, a
  single LED began to blink. The mission was running out of time.
