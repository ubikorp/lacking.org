title: Rhode Island Is Famous For You
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: I can’t say if this is the first time I’ve had a radio show on Independence
  Day, but it is the first time I’ve prepared something special for the occasion.
  Presenting **Affairs of State**, a one-hour set of music dedicated to the States
  part of “United States of America.” As it turns out, there is a wide representation
  among the 50 states (51 if you count New Model Army) in the Lacking Library, but
  I have selected the best 16 examples for this evening.
