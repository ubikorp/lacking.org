category: playlists
description: The Musée National stood like a squat block, facing the highway at an
  angle and mirrored to the left by the library. The hu hu sat inside, waiting in
  the wing housing the musical instrument collection. The surgeon nervously handled
  the endoscope case, dusty from the helicopter ride that had brought them to N’Djamena.
  The calligrapher was clearly nervous but their services would only be required for
  brief minutes while they inspected the inscription on the inside of the ancient
  calabash.
