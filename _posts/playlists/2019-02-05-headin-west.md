title: Headin West
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The vessel floated silently across the Mississippi, as silently as a
  hovercraft possibly could, which was not very silently at all. The two occupants
  of the walnut-paneled bridge listened intently to the sounds of the radio above
  the drone of the fans, one of them spinning the wheel with wild abandon, the other
  plotting an imaginary course over river and land using a nubby pencil and printed
  map. The sextant lay unused, for it was, after all, night.
