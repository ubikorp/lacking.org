description: "“Batu means ‘rock’ in Malay” said the photographer, for the third time
  in a week. The sous-chef ignored the comment, also for the third time, and tried
  squinting in the darkness at the cribbage board. They had been wise enough to purchase
  a glow-in-the-dark deck after all these midnight assignments, but had yet to extend
  their ingenuity to the board. Tapping a foot in irritation, they knocked over the
  thermos full of hot cocoa set on the steps, and it would have rolled down several
  long flights of guano-covered stairs had it not been stopped by the tandem bike’s
  wheel leaning against the statue’s pedestal. Above them, Lord Murugan stared stonily
  into the dark."
