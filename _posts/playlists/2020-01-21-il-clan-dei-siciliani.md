title: Il Clan Dei Siciliani
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Getting into Darra Adam Khel had not been easy.  Getting into Pakistan
  was relatively straightforward, with the right-colored passports and decoy suitcases
  full of Western tourist necessities. The ride towards the Khyber Pass had been less
  so, and the necessary disguises and bribes to get past the checkpoints that turned
  away foreigners were more of an ordeal than ordinary. The dusty vehicle, neither
  truck nor passenger car nor jeep but somehow all three, had been recalcitrant for
  most of the trip, providing constant frequent minor breakdowns, keeping the mechanic
  perpetually busy. Now they were on a shooting range on the roof of a well-stocked
  arms shop, surrounded by dozens of identical shops and shooting ranges. As the linguist
  lifted the replica Berthier carbine to their shoulder, they darkly thought it would
  be just their luck, after all of this, to be caught in some rooftop crossfire from
  other purchasers testing their new toys.
