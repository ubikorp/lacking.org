title: Carnage Bargain
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Would the tour of palaces never end? Having visited several monarchical
  residences, the cobbler had become habitually underwhelmed with the perpetual ostentation.
  Taking a seat at a padded bench to admire the mosaics of Dar al-Makhzen, the topologist
  hummed a Balkan square-dancing melody. The ancient Land Cruiser that had brought
  them here, well-cared for and highly-modified, sat in a modern parking lot that
  clashed with the surrounding Moroccan geometry. They pretended to take some selfies
  while monitoring the 360° camera feed coming from the vehicle.
