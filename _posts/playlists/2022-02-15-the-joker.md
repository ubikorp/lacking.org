category: playlists
description: Sometimes it takes a while for an album to be recognized as a classic,
  sometimes the shock of recognition is instant and universal. This is the case for
  **Spoon** and their latest release, *Lucifer on the Sofa,* which showcases much
  of what has made the band a constant source of solid material, but in a concentrated
  way that will make you start all over as soon as you hit the end.
