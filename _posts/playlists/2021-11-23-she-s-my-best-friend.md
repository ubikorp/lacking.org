title: She’s My Best Friend
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: If The Wedding Present were the traditional sort, they would be bringing
  coral to the festivities. This one is from earlier in their career, closer to the
  wood years, but the Velvet Underground never goes out of style. This is from another
  good VU tribute album, _Heaven and Hell_ from 1991 or so.
