subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The specialist carefully manipulated the waldoes linked to the robotic
  arms in the front of the submersible. The pilot peered out of the top dome, the
  glare of the spotlights illuminating the complex structure of the oil rig but the
  visibility of this part of the Gulf of Mexico not allowing much to be seen past
  the first couple tangles of girders. A single wire tethered the craft to the surface,
  its sole purpose safely delivering the radio signal carrying its obscure music and
  coded instructions past fathoms of seawater. The robot arms clasped the watertight
  bale of Oaxacan tamales tightly. The mission was only half over.
