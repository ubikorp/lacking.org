description: "**Mimi Parker**, vocalist and drummer and half of the Minnesota band
  **Low**, passed away a couple of weeks ago while I was traveling. It’s a shocking
  loss and an abrupt end to a musical career that was still unfolding; the band’s
  last two albums, coming at the tail end of a discography that spans decades, showed
  a blossoming new direction for an act that was famed for their quiet and glacial
  approach. We open the show with Low’s rendition of a Bee Gees classic in tribute."
