description: Let’s face it, we’re going to be hearing tracks from **The Bug Club**
  for a couple months, since I keep finding gems strewn loosely about their most recent
  album. Lots of listeners checked in for this show, my apologies to those that checked
  out during the elevator hellride at the beginning of the show. Technical issues,
  we’re working on them.
