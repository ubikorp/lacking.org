description: The mechanical harvestman towered over the fig grove, its spindly arms
  tucked underneath as it towered over the fruit trees. The cryptobotanist aimed the
  infrared reader at the edge of the cultivated land, where the real Bhutan took over,
  hoping for even a quick glimpse. The landscape gave nothing in return. The operator’s
  headphones leaked the sound of some Turkish reggae, bounced from a satellite to
  overcome the foreboding mountains that ringed the valley. They both had patience
  to spare. The beast they were seeking had only one food source, located right here,
  and everyone’s gotta eat.
