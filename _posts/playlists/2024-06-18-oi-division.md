title: Oi! Division
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Back to the tried and true formula of new, old, obscure, and occasionally
  weird with tonight’s set, which features the return of **Les Savy Fav** and their
  always welcome abrasive electropunk. It’s now that time of year when I enter the
  studio in daylight and exit in pitch black darkness, which I always appreciate.
  In between, there were lots of exciting discoveries. Expect more heavily-censored
  Guppy in coming weeks!
