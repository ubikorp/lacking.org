description: 'There wasn’t enough room on the narrow boat for the botanist to take
  out a handkerchief and wipe their brow. The square head vessel, slicing through
  the water on its way to the Phong Dien Floating Market, looked to be laden with
  mangos, but that was a ruse. The pyramids that piled the boat only a had a skin
  a single mango deep. Underneath were piles of something with about the same density
  as mangos, but much much more valuable. The captain twisted the knob on the cabin
  radio on hearing some narcopolka, the device’s limited capacity making the sound
  increase not in volume, only in distortion. The sun sparkled off the water, a thousand
  heat lasers evading the shade thrown by the wide straw hats they wore. '
