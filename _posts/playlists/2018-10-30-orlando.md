description: A good show, with plenty of lively commentary from the listeners over
  the internets. Hat tip to Generoso and Lily, listening somewhere on the East Coast,
  for reminding me of the rare provenance of the Fishbone track, and for Robin for
  sticking it out into the wee hours in Atlanta.
