title: Right Back To It
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Things started out normally, with a cover and an excellent new single
  from **Waxahatchee**, but took a turn for the unexpected when the highly-anticipated
  Cat Empire set went missing. Was it skipped over on the player accidentally? Had
  I forgotten to make a copy to bring to the station? Could I download it from the
  backup at home? After a couple of sets of troubleshooting, it turned out I had named
  the file incorrectly. These are the hazards you encounter as a live-in-the-studio
  DJ, kids.
