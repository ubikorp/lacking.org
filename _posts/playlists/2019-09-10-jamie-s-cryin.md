title: Jamie's Cryin'
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: There was no official name for this giant hole, this cavern that truly
  made you realize the proper utilization of the word “cavernous”. Those who knew
  of its existence referred to it as the “Sarlacc Pit”, while the geologists debated
  what to call this previously unseen feature in the farthest reaches of British Columbia.
  The ophthalmologist could not help but recount these facts as they descended into
  its depths; they were the chatty sort and had barely endured a few hours of self-reflection
  in the noisy Chinook that had brought the expedition here. The conductor whistled
  a short melody and listened for the glorious reverberation. The nearest person who
  could recognize its Peruvian punk origins was 2,524 miles away.
