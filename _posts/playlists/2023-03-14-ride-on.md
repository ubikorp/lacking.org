title: Ride On
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: As it happens, if yours truly has a Valentine’s gig, it’ll be followed
  by one on Pi Day. Except on leap years. But the point here is that I thought about
  doing a show themed on circles, spheres, and other such expressions of the number
  and decided against it, but keep your ears peeled for some future incarnation of
  a “Round and Round” playlist. Instead, tonight we kick things off with the sort-of
  eponymous track from **The Nude Party**’s latest release, and wrap things up with
  about 30 seconds of Railroad Jerk, because technical difficulties.
