description: The economist wondered where they’d be if the herpetologist had been
  available. Probably not prone under a cover of leaves, covered in protective armor,
  tapping two small bamboo sticks as a ruse to attract a golden lancehead. The rhythm
  was from the single Nordic folk d’n’b that had played on repeat 142 times on their
  trip out of the Port of Santos. It had been difficult to find a captain willing
  to land them on Ilha de Quemaida, so it was not wise to criticize their choice of
  music for the journey. The epidemiologist was nearby, peering into the carefully
  held vial and running the numbers on when it would be filled at the current rate
  of collection, and how quickly they could get off the island once that moment arrived.
