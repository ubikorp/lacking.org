description: If you want suave, it’s hard to get more suave than “Blue Velvet,” and
  horror-surf combo **Messer Chups** delivers a version that’s not only suave but
  also quite kinetic. From the accelerated temp to the lyrical guitar line to the
  luscious spring reverb, it’s a welcome spin on the old croony standard. Tonight’s
  show was accompanied by tremedous wind and lightning, with occasional rain.
