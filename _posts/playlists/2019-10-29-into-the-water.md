subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am

description: The screen door banged against the frame of the small building that was
  once Cisco, Utah’s non-bustling post office. It’s like a ghost town abandoned by
  the ghosts, mused the cinematographer. Whatever once haunted this place left out
  of boredom. Meanwhile, the blacksmith methodically tapped the foundation along the
  perimeter of the building. They had brought the infractometer over from the side-by-side
  they had arrived in, but sometimes the old ways worked best. The rhythm etched out
  a Namibian bossanova that had been popular in the ‘70s. The entrance to the silo
  complex had to be near.
