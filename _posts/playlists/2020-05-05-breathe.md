description: The strategist made to pick up a card, then withdrew their hand. A cool
  breeze, laden with yesterday’s afternoon dust, stirred through the empty square
  near the Musée Ahmed Zabana, knocking discarded paper cups against the stone table’s
  legs.  The tandem scooter, not something you usually see in these parts of Northern
  Africa, come to think of it the world, leaned against the bench the investigator
  slouched on. “Make your move” their eyes implored in exasperation, as the pair waited
  for the gift shop to open.
