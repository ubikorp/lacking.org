description: 'I was not properly prepared to discuss **Cat Power**’s tribute to Bob
  Dylan’s 1966 Royal Albert Hall concert, and specifically where it was recorded,
  but now I can reveal the facts: the Cat Power recording was made at RAH. However,
  Dylan’s original recording was NOT made at RAH, despite the famous bootleg’s common
  name, instead having taken place in Manchester, a good ways away.'
