title: I'm The President
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: I am proud to bring you **KNOWER**, despite the fact that I constantly
  stumble over how to announce the name of the band, trying to tease out the magical
  diphtong that distinguishes it from “nowhere” to the listener. I love them so much
  I will even respect their penchant to spell their name in all-caps. Led by Louis
  Cole and Genevieve Artadi and often spiced with cameos, their take on modern jazz
  funk / funk jazz is always on tap to fix a day going wrong.
