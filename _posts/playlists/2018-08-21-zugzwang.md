category: playlists
description: It was a quiet night... I believe an unearthly materializing of liquid
  water from thin air had people on edge. Elsewhere, the phenomenon is so common it
  has its own word -- "rain" -- but here in the Grand Valley, it's so rare as to trigger
  suspicions of alien interference, chemtrails, or bitcoin market manipulation. Sometimes
  all three.
