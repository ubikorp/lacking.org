subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Why had I not heard of this Zach Hill (Death Grips, Hella) side project
  before? **The I.L.Y.s** hit a lot of my targets — noisy, harshly pop, and completely
  willing to blur the line between the analog and the digital. The video for tonight’s
  feature track is also something to behold, though I’d avoid it if you have a thing
  about bugs. Lots of bugs.
