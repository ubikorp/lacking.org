description: 'The keypad beeped softly as the astronomer keyed in the coordinates.
  It was deepest darkest night on the altiplano, the stars above an unfamiliar configuration
  for those born to northern skies. The physicist tapped their pencil against their
  favorite clipboard (the metal one), the coffee-stained papers clipped to it showing
  the revised calculations for the Hole In The Sky. Over the tinny intercom, hacked
  because both had forgotten to bring a speaker, a particularly ironic song choice
  began to play, making them instinctively share a knowing glance. '
