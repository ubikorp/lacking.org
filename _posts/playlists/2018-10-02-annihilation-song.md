subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 10pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: It’s back to a regular schedule, at least for the foreseeable future,
  and it’s good to be back with the usual cast of characters. A rare and rainy night
  in the Grand Valley, perfect for this random gallop through some haphazard old stuff
  and sparkly new stuff.
