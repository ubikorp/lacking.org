title: Listening to the Higsons
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: I meant to write the notes for this show sooner than a month after the
  fact, but travel plans got in the way and here I am struggling for an intro. I can
  tell you that hearing **Sparklehorse** take on Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians’
  “Listening to the Higsons” for the first time, mere weeks ago, felt like someone
  became obsessed with the same cassette as I did thirty years ago, but actually got
  around to letting the hen out.
