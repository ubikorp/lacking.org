subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The luthier adjusted the direction control of the four-legged arachnoform
  lumbering above the forest of Oro Bay. The spherical contraption had been difficult
  at first, but proved to be intuitive in guiding the transport’s spindly hissing
  legs across the varied terrain. Behind the padded seat, the cartographer consulted
  screens and printouts. The purple spruce should be visible soon. A single trunk
  would yield over a hundred cello bows, worth millions in the underground market.
  They were there to make sure it remained just another tree.
