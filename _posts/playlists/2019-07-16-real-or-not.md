description: The baker took one last look at the cake, sitting on its gold-rimmed
  stand on the veranda, the carefully cultivated gardens surrounding the Palacio Rioja
  visible in the background. If it weren’t for the two backpack stealthcopters leaning
  against the railing, it would be Instagrammable, hashtag noneofyourbusiness. The
  architect finished the final touches, and gave a silent nod. In a smooth motion,
  the two of them had their packs on and had plummeted over the edge, carefully angling
  away to not disturb the icing.
