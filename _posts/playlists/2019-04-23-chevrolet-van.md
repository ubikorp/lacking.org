title: Chevrolet Van
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The landtrain rumbled over something bumpy. Probably a hill, thought
  the conductor, as they made their way down the gently swaying aisle, digital holepuncher
  out, ready to process the ticket. The passenger, sole occupant of the car, sat oblivious,
  staring out the window at the landscape rushing twenty feet below, the faint sounds
  of some Slovakian cumbia leaking out of the expensive earbuds. “Ticket please?”
  The passenger startled, and reached for the sleek titanium briefcase, its embedded
  digital timer declaring to everyone that it held no ordinary cargo.
