title: I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 10pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Out of all the ways there were to get into Zugdidi — they could have
  taken the ekranoplan, for example — the agency had chosen the bus. This exasperated
  the developer to no end. Their gear sat somewhere in the guts of the green behemoth,
  guarded by six different hardware and software protocols, but it still felt queasy
  to be so far removed from it. The meteorologist peered across the botanical garden
  to the Dadiani palaces. Somewhere in there, a nondescript yogurt stand would have
  a small radio playing Konnakkol techno. They were to purchase two cones and overpay.
  Instructions would follow.
