description: The three-hour live shows have settled into their own rhythm, with the
  stranger and more electronic offerings drifting into the territory of **The Final
  Hour**, between 11pm and midnight. This show is for the early risers who might be
  familiar with the upbeat indie pop that gets played at the top of the show but are
  missing out on the darker moods that are featured near the end.
