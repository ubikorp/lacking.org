subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The engineer looked through the diminishing dawn murk and spotted the
  specialist’s orange scarf. The sound of the balloon-tired swamp bikes spread through
  the Estonian bog like hot molasses, obscuring their location but not their presence.
  Unnoticed in the bike’s twin V mud-wakes, a nearly-vertical black snorkel tube trailed
  the pair.
