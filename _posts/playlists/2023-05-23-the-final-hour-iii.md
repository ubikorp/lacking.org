title: The Final Hour III
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: Every so often, I’ll gather up some of my favorite tracks from the last
  sixty minutes of my three-hour radio show and create an entire episode of **The
  Final Hour**, this one being the third such installment. This is the music that
  is played between 11pm and midnight, and it’s generally darker, more instrumental,
  sometimes even experimental, and this is an opportunity for the chronologically
  challenged to experience some of that closer to their regular waking hours.
