description: A listener suggested I slip in Wham!’s “Last Christmas” but as someone
  filled with old-fashioned Lacking Integrity, I politely declined. That said, your
  host survived the season unscathed. In this episode, we dedicate the Middle Hour
  to some fine covers. Shout out to Robin in Atlanta for hanging out in the late-night
  post-holiday gulch.
