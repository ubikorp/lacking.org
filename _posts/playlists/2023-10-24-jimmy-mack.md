description: Out of all the songs to receive **Animal Collective**’s swirling dayglo
  treatment, “Jimmy Mack” might be the most unexpected yet the most deserving. Elsewhere
  tonight, loyal listener Underdog, usually located in the wilds of Georgia, was able
  to tune in around lunchtime while traveling in Japan, making the second show in
  a row with a listener based in Asia. Get me marketing!
