subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: It was a night for mazzy music, starting with a startlingly woozy track
  from **Maya Hawke** and following up with entries from many other exemplary female
  vocalists with a unique sense of melody and delivery. Also, it’s now light when
  I leave for the radio station, and midnight when I return, which adds a sense of
  interdimensional time travel to the broadcasting ritual, I’m going to enjoy that
  for a few more shows before it’s back to operating under the cover of darkness.
