title: Sixty-Two Thousand Dollars in Debt
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: "“Is this the music, is this the music you like?” yell The Bug Club above
  a robotic repetitive riff. Yes, this is the music I like. Tonight’s special seems
  to be bands with names too sensitive to read over the air in Rural Colorado, like
  **Pissed Jeans**, Mannequin Pussy, and STRFKR. No matter, we’ll turn it into a game
  for the listeners."
