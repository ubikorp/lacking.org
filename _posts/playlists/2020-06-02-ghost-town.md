description: The composer stood over the gunwale, pressed the small button, and blew
  into the instrument, discharging the contents into the dark green waters below.  If
  they had known it was going to be this type of floating market, they would have
  picked a different watercraft. This explained the unprecedented difficulties when
  trying to secure their transportation with the Colombo office. The ichthyologist
  indicated one of the floating structures, and began maneuvering their craft towards
  it. The composer took a breath and the signal, a brief segment of “Message To You
  Rudy”, went out from the melodica.
