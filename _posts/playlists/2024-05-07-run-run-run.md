title: Run Run Run
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: 'It was a globe-spanning show, with listeners checking in from the Grand
  Valley, the Florida swamps, and as far as Japan, where it was already Wednesday
  lunchtime. Meanwhile, **The Libertines** are up to their old antics again, at least
  the ones where they sound like a recently unfrozen cadre of British Invasion troglodytes.
  Also fun: playing a track called “We Will Not Apologize” and following that up with
  “Stop Apologizing”. Sounds about right.'
