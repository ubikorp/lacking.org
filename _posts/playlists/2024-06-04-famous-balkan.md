title: The Famous Polka + Balkan Fever
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: It was a day of jet-setting, starting in the dark hours of morning, and
  it wasn’t going to be over until the studio light went off. To keep up the energy
  levels, we presented a double-header of a special, first an hour of **The Famous
  Polka**, featuring songs titled after real (mostly) people, and following that two
  hours of **Balkan Fever**, with music that was far from exclusively Balkan but all
  fed into that manic two-step non-stop feeling.
