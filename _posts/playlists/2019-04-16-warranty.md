description: 'The first mate adjusted the sails, letting out some wind to keep both
  skids on the sand. The sun shone down like a hole punched in a blast furnace someone
  painted blue, the radio broadcasting its gypsy salsa above the hiss of the sandmaran''s
  travel. Leaning on the tiller, the captain let out a yell of warning as they crested
  a dune, gaining air for a brief moment. They still didn’t have a plan for replacing
  the statue, but they had a thousand miles of desert to work something out. '
