title: Upbeat Ritual
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
description: The haberdasher heard a light thump and roll, then felt something tap
  against a shoe. It was a peach pit. Looking up from the stack of brochures, they
  saw the orthodontist grinning and wiping their mouth with a sleeve, glancing at
  the gap on the blanket where the fruit was drying in the sun, clearly suggesting
  that perhaps another one was in order. The tandem moped leaned against the back
  of the Gate of Hercules, shielded by its bulk from the bright Croatian summer sun.
  The peaches had hours to go, and they had forgotten to bring a game., having only
  whatever reading material they had managed to scrape up in the Hotel Pula lobby.
