description: They had been shot at. They had avoided countless booby traps. They had
  been served tiny delicate cups of the most aromatic and poisonous espresso. All
  of these events were framed as interrupted cribbage games. Maybe they played too
  much. The phlebotomist ruminated on this as they locked up their two-wheel drive
  all-terrain motorbikes across the street from Kirov Park. The Transnistrian passports
  had been excruciatingly expensive, but the ergonomist insisted it was justified,
  for complicated political reasons. The pieces rattled against the cribbage board
  and the very dangerous little notebook in the messenger bag as they strolled through
  the trail, looking for a man holding two empty water bottles.
