description: It’s the evening before Valentine’s Day, which means absolutely nothing
  here at lacking org. Instead, we’re opening up with the Sex Clark Five taking on
  the Byrds, and something from Norwegian up-and-comers **Mall Girl**, who manage
  to hold up a broken mirror to American indie rock without cutting themselves to
  shreds. Also, their bassist name-checks Laddio Bollocko. Also tonight, more splendiferous
  instrumental musings from the incomparable Matt Berry to kick off the Final Hour.
