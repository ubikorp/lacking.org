description: The new album from **Jen Cloher** is magnificent, and when her Twitter
  account favorited the playlist entry for the lead track tonight, I near swooned.
  I recommend you listen to *I Am The River, The River Is Me* from start to finish,
  and enjoy something you’ll be doing for years to come for the first time. In other
  news, our recently adopted cat Princess Otoboke Beaver (aka Pris) gave birth to
  four healthy kittens on St. Patrick’s day — Ziggy, Stardust, Spider, and Mars.
